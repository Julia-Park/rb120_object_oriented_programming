1. Write a description of the problem
Twenty one is a card game where each player is dealt a hand and they play against the dealer.  The objective is to beat the dealer and get a hand of cards where the sum of its values are as close to (but not over) 21 as possible.
The cards consist of 2-10 and Ace, Jack, Queen and King.  Numbered cards have the same value as their number; Jack, Queen, King have a value of 10; Ace can be 1 or 11 depending on the sum of the value of other cards.
Players are dealt two cards; each player has the option to hit (add a card) or stay (keep current hand and end turn).  If a player hits and their sum reaches over 21, they busted.
Players have the ability to judge their hand based on the dealer's cards, which are dealt one face up and one face down.  When it becomes the dealer's turn, they will hit until the sum hits at least 17, at which point they will stay.
